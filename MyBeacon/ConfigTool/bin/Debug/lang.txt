label19=Satellites minimum
label17=GPS error treshHold
txtParam7-tt=Number of errors permitted in GPS coordinates reading. In case of exceeding the threshold, GPS interaction ceased in odere to save battery power. Further reading of coordinates is performed 100 times more rarely.

chkParam18_3=Voice
groupBox6=Coords on timer by
txtParam6-tt=Delay until next activity cycle. Measured in minutes. Default is 1200 = 20 * 60, that is 20 hours. Upon completion of search time the beacon goes to sleep for a specified time period.  By default the beacon will wake up after every 24 hours since power on and will run for 4 hours.
label9=Sleep time, min
txtParam5-tt=Search period within which the timer-based beacon is active. Measured in minutes. Default is: 240 = 4*60, that is 4 hours. The beacon will be active within this time, increasing time interval between transmissions. In the beginning and at the end of the search period time interval is defined by corresponding parameters.
label8=Search time, min
txtParam4-tt=Time interval between transmissions in the end of search period of the timer based beacon. Measured in seconds. Default is 60 seconds.
txtParam3-tt=Time interval between transmissions in the beginning of search period of the timer based beacon.Measured in seconds. Default is 10 seconds.

label6=begin
label4=Interval, s
txtParam2-tt=First-time delay before the beacon activation. Measured in seconds. Default is 86400 = 24 * 60 * 60, that is 24 hours. That means that the beacon will be activated and starts transmission in 24 hours after powering on.

txtParam13-tt=Number of transmissions (voice and beeps) of the beacon after call. Default is 3. Signals are transmitted in the following order: beeps then voice, if only this type of transmission is enabled in settings.
label11=Listening duration, ms
txtParam12-tt=Duration of listening to the air. Measured in milliseconds. Default is 50. The bigger the value, the more reliable the call recognition and the higher battery consumption.
label10=Listening interval, s
txtParam11-tt=Time interval for the beacon to listen to the air waiting for a call. Measured in seconds. Default is 3. It is not recommended to set low values due to excessive power consumption.
